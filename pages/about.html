  <h1>About me</h1>
  <div class="statement">
    <p>I'm a true geek from Budapest, Hungary.</p>

    <p>Since my early childhood, I have been showing special interest towards computers. My IT education started when I found the K&amp;R C programming book on my Dad's bookshelf, and tried to compile the Celsius-Fahrenheit converter example, on Borland C for MS-DOS, on my father's 486.</p>

    <p>Since then, I have been continuously self-educating myself in numerous programming languages, like Python, Ruby, C and C++. I soon became a Linux user, and enthusiastic about the Open Source world.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, in high school, I learned low level hardware programming (PIC and AVR assembly), and got a solid knowledge of electronics from my wonderful teachers. Electronics had also became my hobby - I started to iron PCBs, and solder microcontrollers on them :) However, it wasn't for a long time: it turned out that I rather like to search for memory leaks through the night than for soldering faults with a multimeter.</p>

    <p>Around 2006, I realized that being a geek can't really make you a living - so I dived into web development. However it was not my favorite field - it was really ugly, there were chaos because of the browser wars, ugly codes from wannabe PHP coders, marquee tags and Javascript clocks. </p>

    <p>Of course later I found out that that web development can be done as professional and clean as software development - people just don't take the effort to do it. I learned to use MVC frameworks, such as CakePHP, Symfony and Ruby on Rails, cross-browser libraries like jQuery, templating engines, and object-oriented PHP. And with the rise of cloud computing and the social media web development became a mature industry, arguably with more potential than traditional software development.</p>

    <p>So that's why I became a web developer. I always trying to use the latest technologies, HTML5, CSS3, WebGL and other state of the art technologies (of course with backward compatibility taken into account). </p>

    <p>I don't make compromises about quality, and doing things the <i>right way</i>. If you want to whomp something up fast with a yesterday deadline, I'm probably not your guy. But if you want something that's professional in the inside, takes future development into account, and works as expected, feel free to contact me.</p>
