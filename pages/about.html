    I'm a true geek from Budapest, Hungary. I've been working
    as a freelancer web developer since 2009. Currently I work 
    as a frontend developer in the Budapest office of
    <a href="http://www.performgroup.co.uk" target="_blank">
      Perform Group
    </a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since my early childhood, I have been showing special interest 
    towards computers. My IT education started when I found the K&amp;R 
    C programming book on my Dad's bookshelf, and tried to compile the 
    Celsius-Fahrenheit converter example, on Borland C for MS-DOS, 
    on my father's 486.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since then, I have been continuously self-educating myself in numerous 
    programming languages, like Ruby, C and C++. I soon became a 
    Linux user, and enthusiastic about the Open Source world.
  </p>
  <p>
    Meanwhile, in high school, I learned low level hardware programming 
    (PIC and AVR assembly), and got a solid knowledge of electronics from 
    my wonderful teachers. Electronics had also became my hobby - I 
    started to iron PCBs, and solder microcontrollers on them :) 
    However, it wasn't for a long time: it turned out that I rather like 
    to search for memory leaks through the night than for soldering faults
    with a multimeter.
  </p>
  <p>
    Around 2006, I realized that being a geek can't really make you a 
    living - so I dived into web development. However it was not my 
    favorite field - it was really ugly, there were chaos because of 
    the browser wars, ugly codes from wannabe PHP coders, marquee 
    tags and Javascript clocks. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Of course later I found out that that web development can be done as 
    professional and clean as software development - people just don't 
    take the effort to do it. I learned to use MVC frameworks, 
    such as CakePHP, Symfony and Ruby on Rails, cross-browser libraries 
    like jQuery, templating engines, and object-oriented PHP. And with 
    the rise of cloud computing and the social media web development 
    became a mature industry, arguably with more potential than 
    traditional software development.
  </p>
  <p>
    So that's why I became a web developer. I always trying to use the 
    latest technologies, HTML5, CSS3, WebGL and other state of the art 
    technologies (of course with backward compatibility taken 
    into account).
  </p>
  <p>
    I don't make compromises about quality, and doing things 
    the <i>right way</i>. If you want to whomp something up fast with a 
    yesterday deadline, I'm probably not your guy. But if you want 
    something that's professional in the inside, takes future development 
    into account, and works as expected, feel free to
