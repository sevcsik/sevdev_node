	  <h2>Introduction</h2>
	  <p>
		I'm a true geek from Budapest, Hungary. I've been working
		as a freelancer web developer since 2009, and currently I work 
		as a lead frontend developer in the Budapest office of
		<a href="http://www.performgroup.co.uk" target="_blank">
		  Perform Group
		</a>.

		Since my early childhood, I have been showing special interest 
		towards computers. My IT education started when I found the K&amp;R 
		C programming book on my father's bookshelf, and tried to compile the 
		Celsius-Fahrenheit converter example, on Borland C for MS-DOS, 
		on my his 486.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		I have been continuously self-educating myself in numerous 
		programming languages, like Ruby, C and C++. I soon became a 
		Linux user, and enthusiastic about the Open Source world.
	  </p>

  <h2>Education</h2>
	  <p>
		In high school, 
		<a href="http://www.puskas.hu/" target="_blank">
			Puskas Tivadar Technical High School of Telecommunication
		</a>
		I learned low level hardware programming 
		(PIC and AVR assembly), and got a solid knowledge of electronics. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
		I dived into web development around 2006, mostly in PHP and Ruby. 
		Back then it was really ugly, there was chaos because of the browser 
		wars, and it was the age of framesets, marquee tags and Javascript clocks. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
		Fortunately I found out that that web development can be done as 
		professional and clean as traditional software development - people just 
		don't take the effort to do it. I learned to use MVC frameworks, 
		such as CakePHP, Symfony and Ruby on Rails, cross-browser libraries 
		like jQuery, templating engines, and object-oriented PHP. And with 
		the rise of cloud computing and the social media web development 
		became a mature industry, arguably with more potential than 
		traditional software development.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		For a short period of two years, I also enrolled in	
		<a href="http://www.vik.bme.hu/en/education/" target="_blank">
			Budapest University of Technology and Economics
		</a> as an IT Engineer.
		Altough I did not finish the curriculum, I learned a lot of invaluable
		knowledge about about low-level programming, computer architecture,
		design patterns and a lot of other useful things.

	  <h2>Career</h2>
	  <p>
		Since 2009, I'm working as a freelancer web developer. I create responsive
		websites and web applications. I picked up Node.js, NoSQL databases, and
		modern frameworks such as Backbone and AngularJS.
	  <p>
		My first full-time job was at
		<a href="http://kuponvilag.hu" target="_blank">Kupon Vilag</a>, a daily
		deal company. I was working as a web developer, in a LAMP environment.
		Besides backend architecture and sitebuild, I gained experience in 
		online marketing, e-commerce and statistics.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		After I left Kupon Vilag, I decided to get a much deeper knowledge of
		Javascript. My next serious position was (and currently is) at
		<a href="http://performgroup.com" target="_blank">Perform Group</a>.
		I was hired as a Javascript developer, currently I'm the lead architect
		on new Javascript projects. I gained experience in building single-page
		web applications, and I learned a lot about video streaming, 
		advertisements and client-side analytics.
		At Perform, I was also intruduced to Scrum and development in a big,
		multinational environment in general.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		I'm always open to find new challenges. If you have something in mind,
		whether it's a website, an application or something completely different,
		which has to be done professionally and by the book, don't hesitate to
		contact me.
